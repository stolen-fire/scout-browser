description: Export the current browser session as a replayable Python workflow script
argument-hint: "[workflow-name]"
allowed-tools:

---

Generate a self-contained Python script from the current browser session. Follow these steps precisely:

## Step 1: Get the session history

Call `get_session_history` with the active session_id. If no session is active, tell the user they need to run a workflow first using `/scout:scout`.

## Step 2: Extract the workflow steps

From the history, use ONLY these fields to build the script:
- **`navigations`** — the first entry's `url` becomes the initial `driver.get()` call
- **`actions`** — each successful action becomes a step in the script

**Ignore** `scouts` and `find_elements_calls` entirely — those were reconnaissance, not replay steps. Only include actions where `success` is `true`.

## Step 3: Map actions to botasaurus-driver code

Use this exact mapping for each action record:

| action | Code |
|--------|------|
| `navigate` | `driver.get(value)` |
| `click` | `driver.click(selector)` |
| `type` | `human_type(driver, selector, value)` |
| `select` | `driver.select_option(selector, value=value)` |
| `scroll` | `driver.run_js(f"window.scrollBy(0, {amount})")` |
| `wait` (with selector) | `driver.wait_for_element(selector, wait=timeout_seconds)` |
| `wait` (no selector) | `time.sleep(seconds)` |
| `press_key` | Use CDP dispatch pattern from botasaurus_driver.cdp |
| `hover` | Use JS getBoundingClientRect + CDP mouseMoved |
| `clear` | `driver.clear(selector)` |

If `frame_context` is present and not "main", wrap the action with `driver.select_iframe(frame_context)` to get the iframe handle, then call the method on that handle instead of the driver.

## Step 4: Parameterize credentials — MANDATORY

Scan all `type` actions for sensitive fields:
- If the **selector** contains "password" (case-insensitive) OR the action's value was typed into a password-type field: extract the value to a `PASSWORD` variable at the top of the script. Replace the inline value with the variable name.
- If a `type` action targets a selector containing "username", "user", "email", or "login" (case-insensitive): extract the value to a `USERNAME` variable.
- For any other potentially sensitive values (API keys, tokens), extract them to named variables.

**NEVER hardcode credentials in the script body.** Use placeholder values like `"your_username"` and `"your_password"` in the variable declarations.

## Step 5: Compose the script

Structure the script exactly like this:

**When credentials ARE detected** (from Step 4 or pre-parameterized `${VAR}` from `fill_secret`):

```python
"""Workflow: <workflow-name>
Generated from Scout session on <date>.
Session: <session_id> | Actions: <count> | Duration: <if available>

Setup:
    cd workflows/<workflow-name>
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cp .env.example .env   # fill in your credentials
    python <workflow-name>.py
"""
import os
import random
import time
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from botasaurus_driver import Driver

load_dotenv()

# --- Configuration (update .env or override these) ---
USERNAME = os.getenv("USERNAME", "your_username")
PASSWORD = os.getenv("PASSWORD", "your_password")
BASE_URL = "<first navigation URL>"
```

For pre-parameterized `${VAR}` variables from `fill_secret` (e.g., `BC_USERNAME`, `BC_PASSWORD`), use the actual env var names:
```python
BC_USERNAME = os.getenv("BC_USERNAME", "your_username")
BC_PASSWORD = os.getenv("BC_PASSWORD", "your_password")
```

**When NO credentials are detected:**

```python
"""Workflow: <workflow-name>
Generated from Scout session on <date>.
Session: <session_id> | Actions: <count> | Duration: <if available>

Setup:
    cd workflows/<workflow-name>
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python <workflow-name>.py
"""
import random
import time
from botasaurus_driver import Driver

# --- Configuration ---
BASE_URL = "<first navigation URL>"
```

Note: When no credentials are detected, omit `os`, `dotenv`, `load_dotenv()`, and all credential variables. Do NOT include the `cp .env.example .env` line in the docstring. Always include `import random` in both variants — it's used by `human_type()` and randomized delays.

**Common script body (used by both variants):**

```python
def human_type(driver, selector, text):
    """Type text with randomized inter-keystroke delays to mimic human typing."""
    elem = driver.wait_for_element(selector, wait=10)
    elem.click()
    for char in text:
        elem.type(char)
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0.03, 0.12))


def run_workflow():
    """Replay the recorded browser workflow."""
    driver = Driver(headless=False)
    driver.enable_human_mode()
    try:
        # Step 1: Navigate to starting page
        driver.get(BASE_URL)

        # Step 2: <human-readable description of what this action does>
        driver.<method>(selector, value)

        # ... one step per action, numbered sequentially ...

    finally:
        driver.close()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_workflow()
```

Rules for the script:
- Every step gets a **comment** explaining what it does in human terms (e.g., "Click the Login button", "Enter username")
- Steps are **numbered sequentially** starting from 1
- The `try/finally` block ensures the browser is always closed
- Only include the `USERNAME`/`PASSWORD` variables if credentials were actually detected
- The script must be **self-contained** — runnable with `pip install -r requirements.txt && python <name>.py` from the workflow directory

**Realistic timing — MANDATORY:**

Never use fixed `time.sleep(N)` in generated scripts. All inter-step delays must be randomized to mimic natural browsing patterns:

| Scenario | Delay | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| After page navigation (`url_changed` is true) | `driver.short_random_sleep()` (2-4s) | Page loads vary; fixed waits look unnatural |
| After login form submission | `driver.long_random_sleep()` (6-9s) | Login pages need time for server-side processing |
| Between same-page interactions (clicks, typing, selects) | `time.sleep(random.uniform(0.3, 0.8))` | Natural browsing pace |
| After form submission (non-login) | `driver.short_random_sleep()` (2-4s) | Server processing time varies |

The `human_type()` helper already includes per-keystroke jitter (30-120ms) so no additional delay is needed after typing steps that are immediately followed by another type action on the same form.

## Step 6: Determine the workflow name

- If the user provided a name as an argument, use it (slugified: lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
- If no name was provided, derive one from the workflow: e.g., "login-to-reports" based on the navigations and key actions
- Use the name for both the filename and the docstring

## Step 7: Write the workflow package

Write a self-contained directory package to `workflows/<name>/`. Create the directory if it doesn't exist.

### 7a: Write the Python script

Write to `workflows/<name>/<name>.py`.

### 7b: Write requirements.txt

Write to `workflows/<name>/requirements.txt`:

**When credentials were detected:**
```
botasaurus-driver>=4.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

**When NO credentials were detected** (script doesn't import dotenv):
```
botasaurus-driver>=4.0.0
```

### 7c: Write .env.example (conditional)

**Only create this file if credential variables were detected in Step 4.**

Write to `workflows/<name>/.env.example`. Generate from the variables detected:

```
# Credentials for <workflow-name>
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values:
#   cp .env.example .env

# Login username
USERNAME=
# Login password
PASSWORD=
```

For pre-parameterized vars (from `fill_secret`), use their original names:
```
# Username for <site>
BC_USERNAME=
# Password for <site>
BC_PASSWORD=
```

### 7d: Present quick-start instructions

Tell the user the directory path and show a quick-start block:

**When credentials exist:**
```
cd workflows/<name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your credentials
python <name>.py
```

**When NO credentials:**
```
cd workflows/<name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
python <name>.py
```

Also mention what they need to update (BASE_URL if targeting a different environment).
